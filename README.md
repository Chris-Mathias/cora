# Cora: A Multi-Tenant ERP System

## About The Project

**Cora** is a multi-tenant Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system being developed with **Django**. The system is designed with a **service-oriented architecture**, starting with a well-defined data model layer.

The **multi-tenant design** ensures data isolation, allowing multiple organizations to use a single deployed instance securely.

## Current Project Status

**Phase:** Core Data Modeling Complete & Service Layer Implementation in Progress

The project has completed its initial data modeling phase. All core modules have been modeled using Django's ORM. The development is now focused on implementing the business logic within a dedicated service layer.

The following components have not yet been developed:

- **API Layer**: URL endpoints, Views/ViewSets, and Serializers for exposing the system's functionalities.
- **Comprehensive Business Logic**: While foundational services are being built, most cross-module business rules are still pending.
- **User Interface (UI)**: No frontend has been developed yet.
